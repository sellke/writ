# Writ — Product Roadmap

> Based on Product Contract: 2026-02-27, refreshed 2026-07-10 (2026 harness audit — see ADR-010, ADR-011, ADR-012, ADR-013)
> Last Updated: 2026-07-10
> Cadence: Steady — ongoing improvement alongside real projects, compounding over months

**Strategic frame (2026-07-09 refresh):** Harnesses natively absorbed much of what Writ's early phases built scaffolding for (memory, skills, subagents, planning modes, context management). Writ's posture going forward: **keep the harness light, own the contracts, delegate the mechanics** — prune what platforms do natively, expand where Writ compounds (supervised autonomy, evidence-based self-improvement, consolidating memory with external interop).

## Phase 5: Operationalize the Destination — ✅ Closed (spirit met, 2026-07-09)

**Original goal:** Make the production-grade claim falsifiable.

**Closure rationale:** The spirit of this phase was met by work that shipped through other channels: eval Tier 1 runs as a CI gate on every PR, `/verify-spec` is an 8-check diagnostic with auto-fix, drift logs quantify spec-vs-reality per story, and the knowledge ledger exists. Building a separate `/audit` command, `/lessons` micro-command, and per-story scorecards on top would add surface without adding falsifiability.

**Disposition of original features:**

- [x] Falsifiability substrate — met by eval Tier 1 + `/verify-spec` + drift logs (shipped in Phase 4)
- [→] `dependencies:` spec frontmatter — **relocated to Phase 6**, where `/implement-phase` sequencing actually consumes it
- [→] `/status` health score — **relocated to Phase 6** as a one-line summary derived from existing checks (no new `/audit` command)
- [✗] `/audit` command — cancelled (duplicates existing checks)
- [✗] `/lessons` micro-command — cancelled (duplicates `/knowledge`)
- [✗] Per-story scorecards, drift-to-lesson flag — cancelled (ceremony without evidence of need)

---

## Phase 6: Autonomy Ceiling — ✅ Complete (2026-07-10)

**Goal:** Harden normal multi-spec `/implement-phase` as a session-bound, single-confirmation orchestrator and retire Ralph. Single-spec recommended delivery is governed by [ADR-013](../decision-records/adr-013-recommended-autonomous-delivery.md), which supersedes ADR-010's conflicting contract-level gate without extending `--recommend` to phase execution.

**Closure status:** All seven features shipped and verified by eval Tier 1 (`spec-dependencies`, `phase-lanes`, `phase-challenges`, `phase-quarantine`, `phase-knowledge`, `phase-health`, `ralph-retirement`), a disposable multi-spec sandbox UAT, and one real-use User Challenge — see [`acceptance-evidence.md`](../specs/2026-07-09-phase6-autonomy-ceiling/acceptance-evidence.md). Ralph is archived under `archive/ralph/`. **One honest caveat:** the "3+ spec phase runs end-to-end in real use" criterion is proven *mechanically* (sandbox) only — an umbrella spec cannot self-prove it; the first genuine multi-spec `/implement-phase` run (Phase 7 onward) will exercise it live. Not yet released — pending `/release`.

### Dependencies

- `2026-07-10-recommended-autonomous-delivery` — governance reconciliation and the bounded single-spec delivery policy must land before Phase 6.
- Multi-spec `/implement-phase --recommend` remains excluded.

### Success Criteria

- A 3+ spec phase runs end-to-end through `/implement-phase` without orchestrator context degradation (fresh subagent per spec) — ✅ mechanical evidence (disposable multi-spec sandbox UAT in the phase6 spec `acceptance-evidence.md`); a genuine 3+ spec real-use run is outside this umbrella spec and will land with the next real phase
- A deliberately failed spec lands on a quarantine branch without polluting the phase branch — ✅ verified (sandbox UAT + `phase-quarantine` eval)
- At least one mid-run scope decision surfaces in User Challenge format during real use — ✅ satisfied: a real mid-run exit-criteria decision (the stale eval baseline fixture) surfaced to the maintainer, who chose to fix it; recorded in four-part User Challenge format in the phase6 spec `acceptance-evidence.md`
- Ralph fully deprecated: command, script, and docs archived; changelog and README updated; `/status` no longer reports ralph state — ✅ verified (`ralph-retirement` eval + allowlisted search)

### Features

- [x] **Fresh context per spec** `Effort: M` — Each `/implement-spec` iteration runs in a fresh subagent; the orchestrator holds only state, sequencing, and escalation. Ralph's core research finding (fresh-context agents outperform continuous agents), ported into the supervised orchestrator.
- [x] **Quarantine branching on spec failure** `Effort: S` — Failed spec's partial work lands on `writ/quarantine/{spec}`; phase branch stays clean. Inherited from Ralph.
- [x] **User Challenge framing for mid-run decisions** `Effort: XS` — When a condition proposes degrading scope: what the roadmap said / what we recommend / what context we might be missing / cost if we're wrong. Apply ADR-013's evidence-based select-or-pause rule: low-risk reversible choices require observable support and an audit summary; critical ambiguity or material risk pauses. (Borrowed from GStack's autoplan; hardens the Prime Directive where autonomy is highest.)
- [x] **`dependencies:` spec frontmatter** `Effort: S` — Declared cross-spec dependencies replace prose-overlap inference in Step 2.1 sequencing; `/verify-spec` validates references. (Relocated from Phase 5.)
- [x] **Knowledge writeback at phase close** `Effort: S` — Phase report appends durable lessons and drift patterns to `.writ/knowledge/`; the loop feeds the memory.
- [x] **Ralph deprecation** `Effort: S` — Archive `commands/ralph.md`, `scripts/ralph.sh`, PROMPT templates, and docs; record [ADR-012](../decision-records/adr-012-ralph-deprecation.md); point users to `/implement-phase`.
- [x] **`/status` health line** `Effort: XS` — One-line production-grade summary derived from existing checks (eval Tier 1, `/verify-spec`, drift logs). (Relocated from Phase 5.)

## Phase 7: Compounding Layer (2-3 weeks) — Next

**Goal:** Make Writ's self-improvement falsifiable and its skills primitive actually adopted. The learning loop moves from anecdote to evidence.

### Success Criteria

- 3-5 skills extracted from the highest-traffic commands (`/create-spec`, `/implement-story`, `/ship`, `/refactor` are first candidates), each lint-clean and in real use
- Every skill carries lifecycle state (candidate / proven / promoted) with recorded evidence
- At least one `/refresh-command` refinement merged with cited transcript evidence and passing evals — and at least one *rejected* for lacking evidence
- First knowledge consolidation pass merges or prunes real entries with a reviewable PR diff

### Features

- [ ] **Skill lifecycle** `Effort: S-M` — `status:` field in skill frontmatter (candidate → proven → promoted) with evidence recorded per transition; `/new-skill` starts at candidate; `/refresh-command --lint-skills` checks lifecycle hygiene. (Pattern borrowed from GStack's domain-skill quarantine → active-after-3-successes.)
- [ ] **Skill extraction from high-traffic commands** `Effort: M` — Pull reusable capability out of the heaviest commands into skills; commands shrink to orchestration. Targets the essential surface where refinement pays off most. Also resolves the weak content in `/explain-code` (retire the command; its ~10 durable lines become a skill).
- [ ] **Evidence-bound `/refresh-command`** `Effort: M` — Proposed refinements must cite transcript evidence and pass eval Tier 1 (plus a lightweight Tier 2 check for high-traffic commands) before merging. The learning loop becomes falsifiable. (GBrain's `skillopt` sets the industry bar: skills as trainable parameters, keep only measurably better edits.)
- [ ] **Knowledge consolidation** `Effort: S-M` — `/knowledge --consolidate` (or a `/retro` step): merge duplicates, surface contradictions, prune stale entries. Merge, never append — a log grows unbounded; a merged document stays searchable. Markdown in, markdown out, reviewable in PRs.

### Dependencies

- Phase 6 knowledge writeback (gives consolidation real input)

---

## Phase 8: Memory Interop (1-2 weeks)

**Goal:** Writ's markdown stays the canonical system of record; external memory layers become documented, optional, disposable indexes over it. Interoperate, never re-implement. Per [ADR-011](../decision-records/adr-011-memory-interop-markdown-canonical.md).

### Success Criteria

- A GBrain-equipped project can register `.writ/` as a source and answer retrieval queries against specs, ADRs, and knowledge entries
- Removing GBrain (or any index) loses zero canonical data — verified by round-trip
- Each adapter documents how Writ's ledger relates to that platform's native memory

### Features

- [ ] **GBrain compatibility recipe** `Effort: S-M` — Integration skill + docs: register `.writ/` via `gbrain sources add`, map knowledge/specs/ADRs to page types (evaluate a Writ schema pack), add brain-first retrieval guidance when a brain is detected, remove it gracefully when absent. Zero new Writ infrastructure; blast radius is one doc if GBrain's API moves.
- [ ] **Native-memory guidance per adapter** `Effort: S` — Cursor memories, Claude Code memdir, Codex: what belongs in native memory (session preferences, trivia) vs. the ledger (negotiated decisions, conventions, lessons — the reviewable layer that feeds the rest).
- [ ] **Mission language update** `Effort: XS` — "Not a persistent-database knowledge layer" softened to "markdown canonical; external indexes optional and disposable." (Done in the 2026-07-09 mission refresh; verify no stale references remain in README/docs.)

## Beyond Phase 8 (Parking Lot)

**Kept as candidates:**
- **Cross-project learning corpus** — extension of the knowledge ledger once consolidation is proven
- **`/design` Mode A modernization** — Excalidraw hand-authoring is a 2024 technique; revisit with AI image mockups or native design tools via `/refresh-command`
- **Eval Tier 2 expansion** — beyond the Phase 7 lightweight check, if it demonstrates value

**Deferred until concrete signal:**
- **Team affordances** (cross-dev drift reconciliation, `/review-spec`, multi-repo orchestration) — trigger: a second human on a shared Writ project. See [ADR-007](../decision-records/adr-007-team-audience-sequencing.md).

**Dropped:**
- **Opaque, unbounded autonomous loops (Ralph successor)** — deliberate non-goal per [ADR-013](../decision-records/adr-013-recommended-autonomous-delivery.md); bounded single-spec recommended delivery instead uses observable state and one immutable production approval
- **`/audit`, `/lessons`, per-story scorecards** — cancelled at Phase 5 closure
- **Notification integrations, cross-AI parallel coordination, browser daemon** — carried over from prior refresh; still out of scope

## Effort Sizing

| Size | Duration | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **XS** | 1-2 days | `/status` health line, User Challenge framing |
| **S** | 3-5 days | Quarantine branching, `dependencies:` frontmatter, adapter memory guidance |
| **M** | 1-2 weeks | Fresh context per spec, skill extraction, evidence-bound `/refresh-command` |
| **L** | 3-4 weeks | (none currently planned) |
| **XL** | 1+ months | (reserved) |

### Pacing Discipline

Phases 6-8 total roughly 4-7 weeks of focused work at solo-maintainer pace. Each phase ships independently; bundling them is the failure mode to avoid (research addendum Risk #1: solo-maintainer asymmetry).

## Design Principles (Apply to Every Phase)

1. **Adaptive ceremony** — Every feature must justify its weight. More process only when more process is warranted.
2. **Local-first** — Improvements land in the project first. Upstream promotion is optional, never forced.
3. **Dogfood everything** — Use Writ to build Writ. Every feature goes through the pipeline.
4. **Delegate mechanics, own contracts** — If the harness does it natively, adapt to it; never re-implement it. New surface must pass the test: *does this drive output the model wouldn't produce unprompted?*
5. **Aplomb** — Agents should handle complexity with grace, not grind through checklists.
6. **Opinionated by default** — Lead with the recommendation, explain why, then offer alternatives. Judgment, not menus.
