# Writ — Product Mission (Lite)

> Source: .writ/product/mission.md
> Purpose: Efficient AI context for development sessions

## Core Value

Writ is a self-improving development methodology for AI-assisted software development. It gives solo builders the engineering discipline of a great team — structured pipelines, specialized agents, quality gates, and a learning loop that improves through use. Methodology-first, platform-agnostic, pure open-source.

## Target Users

Solo developers shipping real products with AI coding tools who've hit the quality ceiling of unstructured AI development. They need a process, not more prompts.

## Key Differentiators

1. **Adaptive ceremony** — Right-sized process for the size of the change, not one-size-fits-all
2. **Self-correcting pipeline** — Tiered spec-healing when reality diverges from plan (auto-heal small, flag medium, pause large)
3. **Compounding intelligence** — `/refresh-command` loop improves commands through use. Local-first with upstream promotion.
4. **Methodology, not tooling** — Markdown-as-instructions works on any AI platform. Tooling hooks (MCP, skills) extend range without creating lock-in.

## Success Definition

Personal leverage — Writ makes projects dramatically better as measured by: less rework, fewer drift incidents, commands that visibly improve, and the confidence to ship without manual verification of everything.

## Current Phase

**Phase 1 — Foundation:** `/prototype` (adaptive ceremony), tiered spec-healing (self-correction), `/refresh-command` (learning loop).

## Design Principles

1. Adaptive ceremony — every feature must justify its weight
2. Local-first — improvements land in the project, upstream is optional
3. Dogfood everything — use Writ to build Writ
4. Commands are the unit — learning, improvement, distribution all operate on commands
5. Aplomb — agents handle complexity with grace, not checklists
