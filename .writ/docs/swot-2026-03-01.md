# Writ SWOT Analysis — Week 1 Review (2026-03-01)

> Context: After one week of active use across ioyoux and nsemble projects. Discussion occurred in the "writ" Telegram group between Adam and Gawd.

---

## 💪 Strengths

1. **Pipeline is solid.** `/plan-product → /create-spec → /implement-spec → /verify-spec → /release` — well-defined, clear inputs/outputs at each stage.
2. **Multi-agent architecture works.** 6 specialized agents with real separation of concerns — architect can't write, reviewer is read-only, coder does TDD. Gates catch real issues.
3. **Platform-agnostic by design.** Markdown-as-instructions means Cursor, Claude Code, and OpenClaw all work. Adapter pattern is clean.
4. **Contract-first prevents wasted work.** AskQuestion loops in `create-spec` and `plan-product` force alignment before code flies.
5. **11K lines of well-structured documentation.** Comprehensive without being bloated.

## ⚠️ Weaknesses

1. **No feedback loop from implementation back to specs.** When coding reveals a spec was wrong or incomplete, there's no structured way to update the spec mid-flight. The coder adapts, the spec drifts.
2. **No observability during execution.** `/implement-spec` spawns agents but there's no live dashboard, progress stream, or status endpoint. Black box problem.
3. **Heavy ceremony for small changes.** Even a 20-line feature goes through 6 gates. No lightweight mode between `/refactor` (single file) and full `/implement-story` (6-gate pipeline). `--quick` skips review + docs entirely rather than right-sizing them.
4. **No learning across projects.** Each project starts fresh. Patterns discovered in ioyoux don't inform nsemble. No shared best-practices extraction.
5. **Agent feedback loops are fragile.** Review→code→review cycle has a hard cap of 3 iterations, then fails. No escalation path, no partial-accept, no "good enough with known issues" gate.
6. **No rollback or undo.** If `/implement-spec` batch 2 breaks what batch 1 built, there's no structured revert. State tracking exists but recovery is manual.

## 🚀 Opportunities

### New Commands / Skills

| Command | Purpose | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/design` | Visual design companion — wireframes, mockup management, screenshot capture, visual comparison | ✅ **Shipped** |
| `/prototype` | Lightweight mode between "idea" and "full spec." Quick spike with minimal gates — for validation before committing to ceremony. | 📋 Next up |
| `/triage` | Automated issue triage from GitHub/Trello. Pull issues, classify severity, group by spec area, suggest batching into specs. | 📋 Planned |
| `/retrospective` | Post-implementation analysis. What went well, what dragged, where did specs drift? Auto-generates lessons learned, updates best-practices.md. | 📋 Planned |
| `/monitor` | Post-deploy observability. Health checks, error rate monitoring, performance baselines. Closes "shipped → working" loop. | 💡 Idea |
| `/estimate` | Story point / time estimation based on codebase complexity analysis. Effort estimates per story with confidence intervals. | 💡 Idea |

### New Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| Visual QA | Optional Gate 4.5 — compares implementation screenshots against mockups using vision model | ✅ **Shipped** |
| PR Agent | After `/implement-spec` completes, auto-opens a PR with structured description, links to spec, test results, coverage delta | 📋 Next up |
| Spec-healing Agent | When coder deviates from spec (detected by verify-spec), auto-proposes spec amendments rather than failing the build | 📋 Planned |
| Cross-project Memory Agent | Extracts patterns/anti-patterns from completed specs across projects. Builds shared knowledge base for new `/create-spec` runs. | 💡 Idea |
| Dependency Update Agent | Periodic scan for outdated deps, auto-create spec for major updates, run pipeline. Security-audit does the scan; this closes the loop. | 💡 Idea |
| Self-improving Agents | After each review cycle, log what reviewer caught. Feed patterns back to coding agent prompt to prevent repeat mistakes. | 💡 Idea |

### Increased Agentic Delegation

- **Spec-healing** is the biggest unlock — lets the pipeline self-correct instead of hard-failing
- **Cross-project memory** could dramatically improve code quality over time
- **PR agent** removes the manual step between "pipeline green" and "PR open"

### Visual Design Integration (✅ Shipped)

- `/design` command with 4 modes: wireframe, attach, capture, compare
- Visual QA agent (Gate 4.5) auto-activates when mockups exist
- `mockups/` directory added to spec structure
- `create-spec` Step 1.5 asks for visual references after contract lock
- `implement-story` loads visual context into coding agent
- Excalidraw as first-class format (JSON = diffable, committable, AI-readable)

## 🛑 Threats

1. **Context window pressure.** Command files are large (create-spec = 684 lines). As projects grow, agent prompts + codebase context will hit limits. Need progressive context loading strategy.
2. **Platform divergence.** Three adapters = three things to maintain. If Cursor changes `Task()` or Claude Code changes subagent semantics, adapters break silently.
3. **Competing frameworks.** Cursor's built-in agent features are getting richer. If they ship native pipeline orchestration, writ's value narrows to the methodology.
4. **Over-engineering trap.** More gates = more reliability but also more cost/time per feature. Watch ROI curve — at some point another review iteration costs more than the bug it catches.

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **`/prototype`** — Lightweight execution mode. Biggest day-to-day friction reducer.
2. **PR agent** — Automate the manual step after pipeline completes.
3. **`/retrospective`** — Build the learning loop across implementations.
4. **Spec-healing agent** — Let the pipeline self-correct instead of hard-failing.
5. **Cross-project memory** — Long-term quality improvement.
