# Swab Command (swab)

> **⚠️ DEPRECATED:** This command is superseded by `/refactor`, which provides scoped, verified refactoring with multiple modes:
>
> **Migration:**
> - `/swab` (random small cleanup) → `/refactor src/path/file.ts` (targeted analysis)
> - `/swab` (dead code) → `/refactor --dead-code`
> - `/swab` (unused imports) → Your linter handles this. Run `eslint --fix`.
>
> `/refactor` is safer (tests verified after every change), more powerful (module splitting, deduplication, modernization), and more useful (you choose the scope).
>
> This file is retained for reference. Use `/refactor` for all new work.
